 >  I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to
 >  ease maintenance, error handling completeaccording  to an articulated strategy, and performance close tooptimal so as not to temptpeople to 
 >  make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.
